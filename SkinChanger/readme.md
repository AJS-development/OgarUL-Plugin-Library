### Skin Changer!

**Commands**
- rs [add,rem] [id]

### Custom Skins Usage
If you are using custom skins, set customSkins to 1 in the config, and create a new file called customskins.txt. 
You can add each skin per line in that text file and those skins would be used instead of the skins in skins.txt
