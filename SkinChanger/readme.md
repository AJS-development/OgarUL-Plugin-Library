### Skin Changer!

**Commands**
- sc [add,rem] [id]

### Custom Skins Usage
If you are using custom skins, set customSkins to 1 in the config, and create a new file called customskins.txt. 
You can add each skin per line in that text file and those skins would be used instead of the skins in skins.txt

### Next update 1.0.1 
Live updated skins, (No default skin file), but customskins are still allowed.
