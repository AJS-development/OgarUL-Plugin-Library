# Advertisement plugin
Add ad's to the client! (this is to say f you moneyclip, our users get money).


### Why?
Usually, we dont support money making. But we also want to insult Moneyclip. We cant host ads because we are open source and us doing that might get use sued. But if you users host ads instead of us, we can insult them but still be fine.


### Usage
Configure using ads.json.

```
